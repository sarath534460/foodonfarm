            <h3 style="font-weight: 600;margin-left: 200px;">Welcome to Food on Farm Pickles!</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 200px;">Our journey began with a simple love for pickles and a deep-rooted passion for preserving the rich culinary traditions of India.</p>

            <h3 style="font-weight: 600;margin-left: 200px;">Our Story</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 2;margin-left: 200px;">Our story is one of tradition, love, and a commitment to quality. It all started in our grandmother’s kitchen, where the aroma of freshly pickled ginger, mango, and an array of <br> spices would fill the air. Her recipes, passed down through the generations, are the cornerstone of our business. Today, we continue to honor her legacy by crafting each jar of <br>pickle with the same care and dedication.</p>
